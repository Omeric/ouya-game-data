    "description": "Snappy Turtle must swim the dangerous waters, eating as many fish and dragonflies as he can along the way.\r\n\r\nSnappy Turtle offer's two types of play: Casual mode and Marathon mode.\r\n\r\nCasual mode is more relaxed and great for younger children because you can hold the spin icon for as long as you want, meaning if you hold down the spin button the whole time you're guaranteed to make it to the end of the level. You just won't get a very high score or many of the achievements that way.\r\n\r\nMarathon mode offers faster action and much more challenging game play as it limits the duration of each spin to roughly one second.",
