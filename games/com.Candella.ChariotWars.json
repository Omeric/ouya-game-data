Emperor Hadrian announces a major festival to celebrate his first ten years as Roman emperor. The main attraction is a chariot race spanning the entire empire from Rome to Helvetia.\r\n\r\nFamous charioteers from across the vast Roman empire including Greece, Egypt, Judea, Carthage, Hispania, Gaul, Macedonia and Britannia have assembled in the Eternal City. Spectators in their thousands are streaming into the Eternal City for the inaugural race in the Circus Maximus.\r\n\r\nThe air is tense with excitement and anticipation.\r\n\r\nThe night before the first race, one of the charioteers from Judea is found murdered in his quarters. The charioteer had been tortured and crucified to the room\u2019s window. An unknown woman\u2019s body is also found on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe head of the emperor\u2019s Praetorian guard, Quintus Octavian, suspects Rome\u2019s constantly feuding noble families of masterminding the murders. Emperor Hadrian is deeply troubled by the murders. He fears a bloodbath in Rome and in restive Judea. It had only been a few decades since the Roman legions destroyed Jerusalem, the Judean capital and crushed the Hebrew rebellion. The emperor fears another uprising in Judea which could spread to the other conquered Roman colonies like Carthage and Gaul.\r\n\r\nEmperor Hadrian asks Quintus Octavian to take the position of the murdered Judean charioteer and represent Judea in the upcoming chariot race.\r\n\r\nAs Quintus continues his investigation, he is drawn inexorably into the murky world of Roman politics. Quintus has to solve two problems at the same time. He has to keep winning each race to stay in the Championship. He also has to solve the twin murders without himself becoming the next victim\u2026\u2026..",
