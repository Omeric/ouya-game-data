Thanks!\r\n\r\nTake flight in an exciting action packed adventure through the skies of Machine City.  You will roll, dive, and dodge your way through dangerous obstacles in order to safely land on floating islands in the sky. Along the way, you must snag valuable treasures.\r\n\r\nThe story takes place 20 years after the Thundering. This great cataclysm destroyed the world as we know it, and Earth's survivors now live on the floating city of Caen. The Earth has changed, but that doesn't stop Arreon from fulfilling his dream of exploring the skies.\r\n\r\nYou'll fly up to speeds of 300 MPH, acquire awesome Boost and Speed rings, and zoom past gigantic killer beasts. Earn extended jetpack activation zones, and negotiate your way through gas clouds and other hair-raising obstacles. High Flyer is not for the faint of heart.\r\n\r\nHigh Flyer Jetpack Tests includes a hands-on tutorial, full calibration and control settings, a 100+ comic book panel story, and a sweeping musical score befitting an airborne epic. \r\n\r\nThere are two things every kid dreams of having, a Jetpack and a Lightsaber.
