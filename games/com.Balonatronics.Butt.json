    "description": "In 1983, future local access television host and all-around creativity virtuoso Jeremy Kellerman was finishing his B.A. in Communications at Wanetshaw Community College in Dearborn, Michigan. Of course, three short years later, he would achieve his Certification of Advising from DreamChangers Personal Empowerment School of Melville, Indiana [defunct], and in 1988, he would go on to host the famed TV series \u201cThe Jeremy Kellerman Advice Hour.\u201d The rest is history. However, there\u2019s another story from Kellerman\u2019s formative years that has gone untold until today.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with merely obtaining his degree, Jeremy Kellerman was already testing the limits of his incredible creative powers by dabbling in video game programming and design. In March of that year, he set to work on what would become a brilliant project sadly lost to the ages\u2026until now. Inspired by the classics of that era such as \u201cPong,\u201d \u201cPac-Man,\u201d and \u201cRampaging Death Ape,\u201d Kellerman developed a project he dubbed \u201cThe Angelic Struggle.\u201d A deceptively simple yet addictive game, it featured an Angel of Positivity using the Bellows of Self-Empowerment to repel the onslaught of materialism waged by the Clouds of Despair. The game is interspersed with educational and inspirational information about famous philosophers and spiritual leaders, and other pertinent information, pre-dating the 1990s \u201cedutainment\u201d craze by over ten years.\r\n\r\nMatching simple game mechanics with an epic, spiritual storyline, \u201cThe Angelic Struggle\u201d became an instant hit with beta-tester (and Kellerman\u2019s roommate) David Munson. However, Kellerman programmed the game on his trusty \u201cRubendo 5000\u201d personal computational device, and saved the master and sub-ter files on a Balonatronics SAWG-E Flopping Diskette, a.k.a. the infamous \u201cBaloney Disk\u201d released briefly in 1982 by fast food chain \u201cBaloney Hut.\u201d The game was ultimately lost due to the incompatibility of those devices with virtually every piece of technology invented before or since. After the death of Kellerman\u2019s beloved wife, journalist and co-host Victoria Kellerman (ne\u00e9 Mendes), in 1996, the original equipment was lost and \u201cThe Angelic Struggle\u201d was forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Jeremy Kellerman\u2019s nephew, Scott Kellerman, discovered the original \u201cBaloney Disk\u201d containing the game files, stored in a box of collectible ceramic puppies and politically incorrect antique figurines from the antebellum South. Fascinated by the disk\u2019s bizarre history, and with his uncle\u2019s blessing, Scott turned the disk over to his friend Johnny Weinstein, a local computer whiz. Against all odds, the young Mr. Weinstein was able to bring together the correct components to interface with the obscure, antiquated \u201cBaloney Disk,\u201d and import the original game files to a modern personal computer.\r\n\r\nWith the original coding miraculously intact, Johnny Weinstein and Scott Kellerman decided not to let the thirty year old effort go to waste, and resolved to finish and release the game themselves. Under the supervision of Jeremy Kellerman, the game was updated in various ways. Upon Scott\u2019s suggestion, the game title was changed from \u201cThe Angelic Struggle\u201d to simply \u201cButt,\u201d a name, he believes, \u201cresonates with the edgier, hip youth culture of today.\u201d To reflect the title change, the sprites of the player character were also redesigned entirely. A professional pixel artist was called in to redesign another character. Originally referred to as \u201cThe Self-Actualized Self,\u201d now the character is entirely new, featuring a pulse-pounding sci-fi\/Western back-story based on Scott\u2019s own market research into modern gaming. Lastly, the original educational\/informational sections of the game were expanded, to reflect the changes in the world since the game was originally created three decades ago. \r\n\r\nLead Programmer and Restoration Director Johnny Weinstein had this to say:\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the game is really fantastic, and it holds up remarkably well for something originally created in 1983. In terms of game-play alone, it could stand alongside many classics of that era. It was a lot of fun to work on, too, and I enjoyed adding in the updated educational sequences. Though some stuff appeared by itself since I started working on it, and I can\u2019t explain that. Frankly, it\u2019s spooky. It\u2019s as if the program itself was alive, and evolving of its own volition since we re-activated it. I haven\u2019t been this creeped out since Jeremy did that children\u2019s show with the plate thing. Maybe we should study this thing some more before we release it.\u201d\r\n\r\nGraphic Design Restoration Director Scott Kellerman added:\r\n\r\n\u201cYou\u2019re worrying too much. Let\u2019s just get this thing out there and maybe make some money. I want to buy me some Uggs. I bet those old racist figurines in the basement are worth something, too.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut Scott, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s normal for - \u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShut up and go eat a hot dog, nut warbler.\u201d\r\n\r\nJeremy Kellerman concluded with this statement:\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted that \u201cThe Angelic Struggle\u201d is finally going to be released after all this time. I just know that it will become part of the collective consciousness the same way my inspiring television series, \u201cThe Jeremy Kellerman Advice Hour,\u201d did.  Now there will be a whole new way for people to see their own inner potential, and a whole new avenue for people to discover the creative genius and wellspring of pure creativity that is Kellerman.\r\n\r\nThink well, live well, and be well!\r\nJeremy Kellerman\u201d\r\n",
