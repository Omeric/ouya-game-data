    "description": "He's back! Slightly returns in an authentic remake of the original classic arcade adventure.\r\nBigwiz the wizard has left the castle in a hurry, in order to turn the King\u2019s son Newton back into a frog. Indeed, he was in such a hurry that he forgot to pack his spare wand, forgot to lock his laboratory door, and most importantly, forgot to return his utterly stupid, idiotic, incompetent, brain-dead nephew Slightly to his parents\u2019 mud hut in the hills.\r\nOh well, it could be worse. A sunburnt dragon could be running off with the beautiful Princess Croak as we speak. The wizard\u2019s spell cabinet might have been knocked over by a Flaming Octarian Whirlwind, scattering the spells everywhere. His kingliness the King might, in a fit of blind panic, have given Slightly the wizard\u2019s private spell book to read. It might rain.\r\nYou see, it could be worse. But as it is, there\u2019s not a cloud in the sky, a breeze in the air, or a whiff of dragon\u2019s breath to be sniffed. Hang on, where\u2019s that pink fire-breathing creature going with that screaming princess? Is that a gentle wind wafting in through the door, or is it something stronger?\r\nOh no. Get the washing in mother, and lock all doors. Cancel the papers, and shoot the cow. I think it\u2019s going to be one of those days\u2026",
